;;; Installation:
;;
;; Put kmacro-query-extra.el in a directory in your load-path, e.g. ~/.emacs.d/
;; You can add a directory to your load-path with the following line in ~/.emacs
;; (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp"))
;; where ~/elisp is the directory you want to add 
;; (you don't need to do this for ~/.emacs.d - it's added by default).
;;
;; Add the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.
;;
;; (require 'kmacro-query-extra)

;;; Customize:
;;
;; To automatically insert descriptions of customizable variables defined in this buffer
;; place point at the beginning of the next line and do: M-x auto-document

;;
;; All of the above can customized by:
;;      M-x customize-group RET kmacro-query-extra RET
;;

;;; TODO
;;
;; Finish `kbd-macro-decision-menu', and integrate with `one-key-read-list' if available.
;; Create `kbd-macro-condition' function for inserting a cond form in a kbd macro
;; (need to think of good user interface for this).

After executing the named kbd macro the calling macro will continue execution.

You should define and name some macros first using `kmacro-start-macro' (C-x ( or f3),
and `kmacro-name-last-macro' (C-x C-k n)."
